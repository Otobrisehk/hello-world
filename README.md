# hello-world
This is my first attempt at learning to use Git.
Henry Otobrise here! I like programming and have done some extensive programming in Scientific Computing.
I am learning python, although not from scratch as I have written some programs using this language before.
I am also learning to program in Julia.
Wish me luck!
